                <h1>WRA 101 Project 3</h1>

                <p>
                    Welcome to my website! This page will showcase my technical literacies.
                    To me, my technical literacies are the most important skill that I have,
                    as it allows me to manipulate and navigate the technical world.
                    This website is just one of the ways that I can make my stand in the technical world.
                    For this final project, I will be going into detail about this website, how it was created,
                    hosted, and secured from scratch.
                </p>

                <h1>Nginx</h1>

                <div class="left">
                    <img src="images/nginx.png", alt="Nginx"/>
                </div>

                <div>

                    <p>
                        Every website needs to be 'hosted' somewhere. This means that a machine
                        running a webserver is needed to host the website.
                        The webserver I am using is <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a>,
                        which is a very fast and customizable webserver.

                        Nginx also allows me to host internal web services for my home network,
                        and provides access control to ensure that only trusted people can access the services.
                        For example, if you attempt to navigate to <a href="vpn.onet.cool">vpn.onet.cool</a>,
                        you will got a 403 Forbidden error. This is because the VPN site is not accessible from the internet.

                        My webserver is hosted locally on a bare metal machine that I own.
                        Some people rent out machines (or virtual hosts) to host websites,
                        but when I first created my home network, I did not have the money to rent our own machine.
                        Because of this, I opted to setup and host the webserver on my own machine.
                    </p>

                <h1>HTTPs</h1>

                <p>
                    Along with Nginx, I had to configure a technology called HTTPs,
                    which is a secure version of HTTP, as it transfers data over a secure encrypted connection.
                    To do this, I had to obtain and install an HTTPs certificate by a trusted source.
                    This allows clients that connect to my website to confirm that they are connecting to me,
                    and not someone else. I used a service called <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, which provides these certificates 
                    for free if you can prove you own the domain name you are trying to register.
                    This allows my website to be completely secure! If you lock in the address bar, 
                    you should see a lock icon, which means this site is secured by HTTPs. 
                    If you click on the lock, then you can see some extra info about my certificates.

                    A project by the name of SSL Labs allows websites to test their HTTPs configuration to ensure that it is secure.
                    You can check out my results <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=onet.cool">here</a>.

                </p>

                <h1>Domain Name</h1>

                <p>
                    A domain name is a service that allows humans to identify a website.
                    When computers connect to a website, they need an IP address.
                    For humans, memorizing an IP address is a huge pain,
                    so we use domain names instead.

                    A domain name ties a name to an IP address.
                    So instead of memorizing and typing out a IP address,
                    you can type a domain name instead.

                    If you want to learn more about my domain name, you can use a whois service.
                    whois allows people to see the personal info of the person who owns the domain name.
                    I bought my domain name from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap</a>, which provides whois privacy protection.
                    This means that many fields are hidden from the public.
                    You can check out my whois report <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/onet.cool">here</a>.
                </p>

                <h1>Bot Protection</h1>

                <p>
                    The internet is a dangerous place, so it is expected to get a bunch of requests
                    from bots attempting to scrape info and exploit vulnerabilities.
                    I utilize multiple technologies to protect my website from these attacks,
                    that I unfortunately can't get into due to security reasons.

                    I can show a snippet of my daily log report that documents potential bot attacks:

                    There is a lot here! The sections to look at though are 400, 403, and 404 sections.
                    Each error is usually a bot trying to talk to vulnerable services.
                    Luckily, I don't serve these services, so the bot gets a 404 error.
                    If one host gets too many 404 errors, it probably is a bot, and it is then banned.
