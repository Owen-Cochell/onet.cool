                Here is a brief description of the slick page!
                I'm sure whatever is on this page subverts our expectations,
                and re-defines the meaning of life itself.
                Get ready, this page may shatter your fragile hold on life,
                and propel you into a new dimension of being. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This section will usually contain the description of your choosing,
                which will usually consist of who you are, description stuff, info,
                blah blah blah blah blah,
                random messages,
                cool things, uncool things, semi-cool things, moderately cool things.
            </p>
            <p>(I'm trying to add more text here so this description does not look awkward...)</p>
            <p>You get the picture. Anything you want here will be placed here.</p>
