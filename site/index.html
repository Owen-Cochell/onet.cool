            <h1>Welcome to ONet!</h1>

            <p>My name is Owen Cochell.
                I'm just a fellow human who enjoys working and using computers
                (Maybe a little too much).
                I like to fancy myself as a semi-competent software developer,
                but you can be the judge of that.
                I work on a lot of random stuff, some hardware related,
                others math related, and even more so software related.
                If you can't tell already, i'm kind of a <s>no-life</s> super cool guy!
            </p>
            <p>ONet contains info about myself, my projects, and other random things
                that find their way onto this godforsaken site.
                This site will(hopefully) be updated semi-regularly,
                so keep an eye out for new content.
                Hopefully you find something of worth here!
            </p>
            <p>This website is my attempt at learning basic web development
                (and a touch of  system administration),
                so please excuse any poorly designed components.
            </p>
