# About

'onet.cool' is the personal website for Owen Cochell.
It contains personal info, projects, demos, and basic apps created by me!

ONet is used as a major learning experience, 
so expect some jankiness and unprofessionally.
All components
(with the exception of [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/))
are written by me.
ONet is hosted on my personal machines as of now,
although this may change in the future.

We use GitHub to synchronize the state of onet across many devices,
allowing changes to be pushed to my production server from my personal machine.

# ONet Site Map

    * [index](www.onet.cool/index.html) - Main page for ONet
